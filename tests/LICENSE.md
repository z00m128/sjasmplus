This "BSD 0-clause" license is applied recursively to everything in this
"tests/" folder (this does not affect the BSD 3-clause licensing of assembler
sources outside of the "tests/" folder), except when particular test has its
own specific license accompanying the test files (then the specific license
does apply).
