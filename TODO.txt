LUA quirks:
    -- v includelua:
    function inc_ld(reg, val)
        _pc('LD '..reg..','..val)
    end
    -- v kode:
    LUA
        inc_ld(A, pass)     -- bug, should be 'A'
    ENDLUA
= no output, no error, just dies. ... Seems like any LUA syntax error does that, just dies.

Z80: multi-argument/strict: introduce the options

FIXME in sources mark further points worth refactoring

FIXME: get rid of ParseDirective_REPT somehow, its existence can't be right
(breaks ` .34 repeatX` directive probably? .. and END@beginningOfLine? .. actually not?)

SplitLuaErrorMessage - add some tests after Liniya fix, maybe review the code more.

"--lst" bez hodnoty nech spravi default nazov sam
  ==> needs tests (badly, was bugged a lot during development)

ReadBufLine parsing refactored. Now look for other parts of code trying to do similar things and refactor too..

I almost certainly broke some STRCPY/STRCAT max-size limits (i.e. malicious source may buffer overflow)...

from env. variables disc: nie, myslel som ako "SJASMPLUSEXT" premennu ktora by tvorila priamo obsah pre
ten `--ext` switch... pouzitie stylom ako "prilep k command line" mi nenapadlo... nieco ako CFLAGS
v Makefile? ... na to by som dal ale druhu premennu "SJASMPLUSFLAGS"

Macro world issues:
- macros for operators? (in ideal case `zeuskeyaddr` possible to recreate in macro?)
- more operators, capable of some string manipulation and maybe some type/expression checks (islabel)
- ability to issue real instruction (ignoring possible macro of same name)

Input file without extension does produce wrong default output filename

SAVEHOB/SAVETRD/SAVETAP/... global review of filename handling, adding warnings/errors
where filename modification happens or filename is invalid.

** Macro/define substitution rules and implementation (proposal):
- macro arguments substitute with priority, from the longest ones
- macro arguments substitute even in define related directives
- define arguments substitute next, from the longest ones (inc. defarray)
- name of define/macroarg starting with underscore prohibits substitution into middle
(can substitute only at beginning)
? extend that rule to underscore at end sealing also the tail?
- lock some keywords for define/etc... at least put them under warning
- inhibitor of substitutions/macros happening (like `@djnz` always assembled as djnz inst.
** Current refactored implementation:
- doesn't play priorities as proposed above
- evaluation of defarray index is still flaky and doesn't work correctly inside macro/etc
- needs lot more testing and cleanup
+ should be already a bit more intuitive than 1.08+ (although it may break legacy source)

ZX128 snapshot default state and mapping - still doesn't survive simple `ret` into BASIC

DISP inside DISP bugs => documented. Correct solution = nesting DISPs?!

$$label operator to get label page. (and fix pages for defl/equ/expression/... labels)
//// syntax summary:
    labels (\.|@|)[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_.?!#@]*
    , argument-separator    : instruction-separator     ; // comment
    # $ hexnums, % binary, "' strings, () parentheses or memcell, [] memcell, {} device mem
    operators-unary: ! ~ + - low high not
    operators-binary: * / % mod + - << >> >>> shl shr <? >? < > <= >= = == != & and ^ xor | or && ||
    us keyboard: ~!@#$%^&*()_+`-=[]{};':"<>?,./\|
    $$label - hexa are single $ only, so this looks fine (unary operator)
    ?label - 5<?label => ambiguous
    \label - looks weird, no syntax clash
Needs more syntax:
    - reformat label into different slot... <slot>$$expression ? (binary operator)
    - differentiate 16+b address space from 16b slot-mapped address space.
        &label/expression? Similar to C/C++? &0x1231241 ? (5123 + &1234)

MMU:
- custom pages order for wrap-next-mapping option (like "<3, 5, 1, 2>" ?)
- err/warn/warp option for slot range?

SAVENEX - autodetection of banks? just trivial, make <5, 2, 0> manual and rest is
"if non zero => save"?? Sounds simple to create.

sjasmplus 2.x/fork:

address space of labels -> 2|3:30|29 bits, the top bits being default slot number,
remaining bits being physical address into global chip address space
-> then producing machine code using the particular label would "format" physical
label value for particular "slot" (view of value).

To stay backward compatible/similar, one would have to support also 0000-FFFF range as if
going through the mapped pages.. but that does collide with early pages 0..n ...
How about abusing "@" or "." or something to distinguish between? (& resembles C/C++!)

^^ link each?
