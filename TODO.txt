scratch area + TODO keeper for sjasmplus developers:
====================================================


====================
Ped:

parser.cpp ParseExpShift and other "needa" doing transformations (shr => '>' ???)
- write tests trying those "while" loops for groups of operators
- write tests testing operator precedence

CSPECTMAP - needs better support for DISP and instances of STRUCT

--syntax: "I" to uppercase all labels + usage (needs labels refactoring)
--syntax: L options implementation
    add DOCS example test: "hl: Ld a,(hl),,de,hl" when all is implemented

static analysis: PVS-Studio https://www.viva64.com/en/m/0036/

FIXME in sources mark further points worth refactoring

FIXME: get rid of ParseDirective_REPT somehow, its existence can't be right
(breaks ` .34 repeatX` directive probably? .. and END@beginningOfLine? .. actually not?)

SplitLuaErrorMessage - add some tests after Liniya fix, maybe review the code more.

ReadBufLine parsing refactored. Now look for other parts of code trying to do similar things and refactor too..

I almost certainly broke some STRCPY/STRCAT max-size limits (i.e. malicious source may buffer overflow)...

Macro world issues:
- macros for operators? (in ideal case `zeuskeyaddr` possible to recreate in macro?)
- more operators, capable of some string manipulation and maybe some type/expression checks (islabel)
- ability to issue real instruction (ignoring possible macro of same name)

SAVEHOB/SAVETRD/SAVETAP/... global review of filename handling, adding warnings/errors
where filename modification happens or filename is invalid.

** Macro/define substitution rules and implementation (proposal):
- macro arguments substitute with priority, from the longest ones
- macro arguments substitute even in define related directives
- define arguments substitute next, from the longest ones (inc. defarray)
- name of define/macroarg starting with underscore prohibits substitution into middle
(can substitute only at beginning)
? extend that rule to underscore at end sealing also the tail?
- lock some keywords for define/etc... at least put them under warning
- inhibitor of substitutions/macros happening (like `@djnz` always assembled as djnz inst.
** Current refactored implementation:
- doesn't play priorities as proposed above
- evaluation of defarray index is still flaky and doesn't work correctly inside macro/etc
- needs lot more testing and cleanup
+ should be already a bit more intuitive than 1.08+ (although it may break legacy source)

ZX128 snapshot default state and mapping - still doesn't survive simple `ret` into BASIC

DISP inside DISP bugs => documented. Correct solution = nesting DISPs?!

$$label operator to get label page. (and fix pages for defl/equ/expression/... labels)
//// syntax summary:
    labels (\.|@|)[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_.?!#@]*
    , argument-separator    : instruction-separator     ; // comment
    # $ hexnums, % binary, "' strings, () parentheses or memcell, [] memcell, {} device mem
    operators-unary: ! ~ + - low high not
    operators-binary: * / % mod + - << >> >>> shl shr <? >? < > <= >= = == != & and ^ xor | or && ||
    us keyboard: ~!@#$%^&*()_+`-=[]{};':"<>?,./\|
    $$label - hexa are single $ only, so this looks fine (unary operator)
    ?label - 5<?label => ambiguous
    \label - looks weird, no syntax clash
Needs more syntax:
    - reformat label into different slot... <slot>$$expression ? (binary operator)
    - differentiate 16+b address space from 16b slot-mapped address space.
        &label/expression? Similar to C/C++? &0x1231241 ? (5123 + &1234)

MMU:
- custom pages order for wrap-next-mapping option (like "<3, 5, 1, 2>" ?)
- err/warn/warp option for slot range?

Kate syntax: broken with LUA block containing "end" keyword (maybe even consider including Lua highlight rules from KDE defaults, if it's possible)
    - also missing MMU ?
    - backward slashes in path strings are not working as escapes, single "\" there is OK, but syntax highlight thinks it's "DB" like string.

AppVeyor CI for windows clang + mingw + MSVS2015 builds?

##### sjasmplus 2.x/fork:

EQU and DEFL to not affect local labels (not defining new "main" label)

Operators precedence: (2 == 3&2) = ((2 == 3)&2) = false in current sjasmplus... ????
    https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence

address space of labels -> 2|3:30|29 bits, the top bits being default slot number,
remaining bits being physical address into global chip address space
-> then producing machine code using the particular label would "format" physical
label value for particular "slot" (view of value).

To stay backward compatible/similar, one would have to support also 0000-FFFF range as if
going through the mapped pages.. but that does collide with early pages 0..n ...
How about abusing "@" or "." or something to distinguish between? (& resembles C/C++!)

Make --syntax=abflL default for v2.x and check other defaults
Maybe add support for escaped '\'' and other combinations back, to be more C++ compatible

Check about other syntax ambiguities, what seems too much relaxed and could be stricter for v2.x

N-pass

new lua + js support?

Refactor filepath functions to deal with backward slashes systematically
(or maybe just wait few more years, can't be that long now before windows are gone)

Big-text-block directive? (there's INCBIN workaround using separate file)

====================
Docs:

SHELLEXEC "if (... + ...)" ??? WTF? LOL.

"pseudo-ops as SAVEBIN, SAVEHOB, SAVETRD, SAVETAP, PAGE, SLOT, LABELSLIST and use special functions in Lua scripts."
^^ link each?

DEVICE needs better description? Issue #55

1.14.0 changelog:
- INCLUDE bugfix, now searching paths according to original documentation (may break some projects)
- R800 MULUB was producing wrong opcode all those years... fixed.
- MODULE names can't contain dot any more, MODULE/ENDMODULE resets non-local label to "_"
- expression evaluator was not stricly 32 bit (64b binaries could have produced different results than 32b binaries)
- several tests added to improve the code coverage: https://coveralls.io/github/z00m128/sjasmplus?branch=master
- as tests were added, minor bugs were found and squashed (errors wording, etc)

INCLUDE bugfix note:

If you have project like:
src/a.asm
src/b.asm

and you are assembling it with `sjasmplus src/a.asm` and `src/a.asm`
is doing `INCLUDE "src/b.asm"`, you need either fix the relative path
to `INCLUDE "b.asm"` or add `-i.` option: `sjasmplus -i. src/a.asm` to
give "src/b.asm" path chance to be found from that include path.
